## Purpose

RESTy is an API testing tool that can be run in a web browser. It allows users to interact with APIs using a simple interface. Currently, the four basic HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) are supported along with a request body. In the future, I hope to add functionality that includes the following:

- Set request headers
- Keep a record of past requests in local storage
-
